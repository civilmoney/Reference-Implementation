About Civil Money Artwork
=======================


These *.design files open using Microsoft's free Expression Design 4.0 software, which I prefer over Adobe Illustrator, since it exports paths/vector data to clipboard with Ctrl+Shift+C.

Both files are basically rough sketch/mockup work spaces, not particularly carefully organised or designed, but provided for completeness.

**AboutPageIllustrations.design** are original works and now public domain.

**UIElements.design** contain purchased/licensed vectors by the [Glyphicons Pro](http://glyphicons.com/) set as well as [Trendy Thin Line](https://graphicriver.net/item/1567-trendy-thin-line-icons/7918723) by iconsoul.
