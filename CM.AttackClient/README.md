Network Attack Simulation Client
===========

The purpose of the CM.AttackClient is to eventually take a pro-active approach to attach mitigation and also just for locally stress testing the CM.Server. 

**Please don't run this on the production network.** 

Whilst the whole point is that the production network should become impervious to attacks simulated here, it adds an unnecessary burden during Civil Money's initial pilot phase having only a small number of servers.
