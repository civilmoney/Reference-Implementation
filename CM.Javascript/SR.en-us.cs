HTML_ABOUT_1_1, ""Imagine if you didn't have to work."",
HTML_ABOUT_1_2, ""What would you do?"",
HTML_ABOUT_2_1, ""Today we work because we need money to survive."",
HTML_ABOUT_2_2, ""But why does it have to be this way?"",
HTML_ABOUT_3_1, ""What if instead, everybody had a generous basic allowance and we were free to pursue whatever it is we're truly passionate about?"",
HTML_ABOUT_3_2, ""Today's monetary system is based upon debt and an illusion of scarcity, which if you think about it, seems rather counter-productive and uncivilized.<br/><br/>Let's try something else..."",
HTML_ABOUT_4_1, ""Every person whether retired, studying, disabled or working receives a generous basic income."",
HTML_ABOUT_4_2, ""Roughly equivalent to USD $60,000 /yr. The idea is that <b>if</b> you work, it is gravy. Work on something because you're passionate about it, not because you have to. Raise your kids properly. Go to school. Do something amazing. If the people and local businesses that you rely on for day-to-day living all choose to accept payment in Civil Money, the decision will be up to you."",
HTML_ABOUT_5_1, ""There are no more banks, foreign exchange rates or financial speculation markets."",
HTML_ABOUT_5_2, ""Every user of Civil Money is a money lender. By accepting payment from a person or business, even if they have a low credit score or a negative account balance, you are extending trust. You get paid either way by simply clicking 'accept' on a payment, but the question to ask is, <em>&quot;should I?&quot;</em> <b>You are the bank</b>, and the level of compassion towards a customer's personal circumstance is up to each individual business or seller."",
HTML_ABOUT_6_1, ""There is no such thing as physical cash."",
HTML_ABOUT_6_2, ""There are only publicly visible and verifiable balances and credit scores, which imply a level community good-standing. Credit scores offer an insight at a glance for low value everyday purchases, while in-depth transaction analysis and reporting can more thoroughly validate an account's legitimacy for higher priced transactions."",
HTML_ABOUT_7_1, ""The value of one Civil Money is always equal to one hour of a person's time."",
HTML_ABOUT_7_2, ""The mathematical constant of time can help prevent inflation, however goods and services must be priced appropriately. Civil Money only works if we spend wisely and scrutinize the fair value of items and services that we're purchasing (labor + materials + a reasonable margin) to stop things getting out of hand.
<br/><br/>A reasonable exchange rate in traditional currency is <b>//c 1.00 = USD $50</b>. This is based on an upper-middle class USD$ 80,000/yr income over an 8hr work day, 200 days a year (excludes 165 days of weekends/personal/sick/vacation time.)
<blockquote>USD$ 80,000 / 1600hrs = $50/hr.<br />
Since 1hr = //p 1.00 it follows that //p 1.00 = USD$50</blockquote>
This means that a person making designer T-shirts in Bangladesh, which might take a few hours, can no longer be expected to sell their time for a pittance or be compelled to work for a slave wage. Provided that they have access to materials and a personal website, that person can now sell their shirts directly to anybody in the world for a fair value of //p 3.00, equivalent to USD$150, or about what a retail chain might charge in western countries today."",
HTML_ABOUT_8_1, ""Payments begin to depreciate after 12 months."",
HTML_ABOUT_8_2, ""This means it is impossible for a minority to hoard cash as they do today. Instead, everybody is encouraged to spend their money soon, which ensures the distribution of wealth and a happy and healthy economy.<br/>
<br/>Capitalism is not prohibited, however your capital can no longer be held long-term in the form of money. Instead it must be converted into physical assets and property."",
HTML_ABOUT_9_1, ""Because payments depreciate, your credit score automatically restores itself if you fall on hard times."",
HTML_ABOUT_9_2, ""Depreciation of account debits along with a perpetually replenishing basic income ensures that people retain their dignity in the event of financial disaster. Nobody needs to struggle without access to essential goods and services for an extended period of time, if at all."",
HTML_ABOUT_10_1, ""Inverse-taxation generates revenue for regions based on economic activity."",
HTML_ABOUT_10_2, ""Tax evasion is impossible, we don't subtract money out of pocket and there is never any tax filing.<br/><br/>10% of every settled transaction is automatically generated and placed into an authoritative Civil Money account for the seller's geographical region. Any change to the inverse-taxation algorithm will not directly impact people's account balances. Inverse-taxation is a data analysis/computer sciences problem. Specifically, we exclude transactions for inverse-tax when a money trail or account looks like it might have been deliberately created to generate false revenue."",
HTML_ABOUT_11_1, ""All account and transaction information is public and distributed around the world."",
HTML_ABOUT_11_2, ""Data is stored on random untrusted computers and authenticity is established through a consensus model and well-established cryptographic signing techniques.<br/>
<br/>There is nothing novel or unique about Civil Money's technology.<br/><br/>
Because all data is public, it cannot be used for crime. Not that crime need exist in the first place, given the generous basic income. Predatory or deceitful users should be declined, ignored and politely reminded of the Civil Money Honor Code."",
HTML_ABOUT_12_1, ""Every person can vote on changes to the system."",
HTML_ABOUT_12_2, ""People can digitally sign votes in the same manner as regular transactions. A two-thirds majority is needed for any proposition to pass, meaning a significant winning margin is required before any changes are introduced. No vote counts more than another, however the minimum requirement for voting is a good standing and at least one settled transaction for every 30 day period, for the past year. This is simply to deter casual vote stuffing.<br/><br/>Because Civil Money is a completely transparent system, researchers are encouraged to collect, validate and calculate results independently and report their findings. Voting outcomes are a scientific process and not locked in stone until a consensus with a reasonably low margin of error is established."",
HTML_ABOUT_13_1, ""'Double spending' is allowed. As such, dispute resolution is built-in."",
HTML_ABOUT_13_2, ""In the event of a dispute, a customer can always get their money back whilst the seller keeps their payment as well. <br/>
<br/>The catch is, it reflects badly on anybody who abuses this system, or any seller who routinely does not volunteer a refund during disputes. This creates access to fair dispute resolution in any nations that currently have no reliable legal system in place, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on small-claims courts in the countries that do."",
HTML_ABOUT_14_1, ""Implications."",
HTML_ABOUT_14_2, ""<h3>Potential Negative Implications</h3>
<ol>
<li>Privacy doesn't exist, meaning there is a potential for doxing or identity theft when the account ID is associated with a known physical identity. On the other hand, Civil Money users are at least cognizant of the visibility of their activities, and companies could one day end the practice of using bills as a form of identity verification.</li>
<li>Civil Money is presently open to internet blocking techniques. This can be partially addressed with the use of native/non-web browser based apps.</li>
<li>Necessity is sometimes said to be &quot;the mother of invention&quot;. Removing that necessity may or may not stall technological progress. We can only hope that it does the exact opposite and inspire people to invent amazing technological and scientific breakthroughs, because they no longer need to waste their time putting food on the table.</li>
<li>Fewer people will be willing to do unpleasant tasks. For this reason the people that do them should be held in the highest regard by the those around them. Meanwhile, we should be working on ways to eliminate unpleasant tasks through technology.</li>
<li>Sudden widespread affordability of general goods by everyone could mean increased productivity, potentially having a negative environmental impact.</li>
</ol>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Potential Positive Implications</h3>
<ol>
<li>Because you don't <em>have</em> to work, Civil Money eliminates our unsustainable profit-driven economy, which relies on imaginary short-term gains (fiat currency) at the expense of real and finite resources.</li>
<li>Poverty need no longer exist. There is not usually a compelling reason to decline a Civil Money payment from any person in need. They're always 'good for it', and our mental model of money's scarcity or perceived idea of what money is worth needn't even exist.</li>
<li>Money no longer infers power or status. One can only speculate as to the geopolitical outcome where every country and person within those countries are on an even playing field.</li>
<li>Wealth and quality of life is no longer generally predetermined by birth family and geographical place of birth.</li>
<li>Monetary based crimes are both unnecessary and trivially traced. Other types of criminal activity typically brought on through shear desperation or necessity could be greatly reduced if not eliminated.</li>
<li>Tax evasion is both impossible and unnecessary.</li>
<li>Regions are implicitly seeded revenue for social services and infrastructure based on the true local productivity of its people.</li>
<li>Inflation need not exist as //c is pegged to time/labor.</li>
<li>A unified currency reduces global trade barriers and creates fairness and equality for every person on Earth.</li>
<li>The positive environmental impact from reducing 'for profit only' resource destruction could be substantial. We hope that it will be greater than the negative impacts of increased productivity through widespread affordability.</li>
