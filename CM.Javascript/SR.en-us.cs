<li>I will try my best to not be a jerk. If somebody is being one to me, I will either ignore them or politely remind them about the Civil Money Honor Code.</li>
<li>I will respect any person's decision to decline my payment, regardless of reason or for no reason at all.</li>
<li>I will hold in the highest regard any person doing an unpleasant job in exchange for Civil Money and endeavor to eliminate unpleasant jobs through the sharing of ideas, science and ingenuity.</li>
<li>I accept that Civil Money is backed only by the community at large and holds no intrinsic value, and is also an imperfect system. As such, the higher the cost of a good or service, the closer I will scrutinize a person's credit rating and transaction history, just as banks do today for a loan.</li>
<li>I accept that the value of all Civil Money transactions begin to depreciate to zero after 12 months, which helps to stimulate the economy, aids in the prevention of inflation, over accumulation of money, and forgives people of their debts to society.</li>
