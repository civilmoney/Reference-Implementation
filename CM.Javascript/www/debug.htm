            <h1>Civil Money</h1>
            <h2>Civil Money is a debt-free monetary system.</h2>
            <div>The end-game for Civil Money is to enable every person on earth to be able to raise their
family properly or get on with doing whatever it is they're truly passionate about or good
at, regardless of whether or not that skill is in high demand or pays a regular income. If
you're musician, perform. If you're a mother, raise your children. If you're a builder, build
something awesome. If you're a researcher, solve a problem. Not for the money, but
because you think it's worthwhile. A universal basic income frees every able-bodied person
to progress humanity as whole, instead of this absurd and relentless pursuit of money,
which is nothing more than a database entry sitting on your bank's computer. We are
wasting our entire lives, killing one another, compromising on our morals, all because
we've created an unnecessary artificial need of money to survive.</div>
            <div>With a purely algorithmic and reputation-based approach to wealth distribution,
non-productive and destructive for-profit-only industries could fall by the wayside. Every
user of Civil Money is in effect a money lender. There is nothing preventing you from
accepting money from a person with a low credit score or even a negative balance -- you get paid
either way by simply accepting their payment. The only question to ask is, <em>should you</em>.
Predatory or deceitful users should be declined and gently reminded of the Civil Money Honour Code -
try not to be a jerk. The level of compassion towards a customer's personal
circumstance is up to each individual business or seller.</div>
            <div>The Civil Money monetary system is not a platform for communication or advertisement. As such
posting of e-mail addresses, phone numbers, personal information or methods of contact are
expressly discouraged.</div>
