            <h1>Civil Money</h1>
            <h2>Civil Money is a debt-free monetary system.</h2>
            <p>
                The end-game for Civil Money is to enable every person on earth to be able to raise their
                family properly or get on with doing whatever it is they're truly passionate about or good
                at, regardless of whether or not that skill is in high demand or pays a regular income. If
                you're musician, perform. If you're a mother, raise your children. If you're a builder, build
                something awesome. If you're a researcher, solve a problem. Not for the money, but
                because you think it's worthwhile. A universal basic income frees every able-bodied person
                to progress humanity as whole, instead of this absurd and relentless pursuit of money,
                which is nothing more than a database entry sitting on your bank's computer. We are
                wasting our entire lives, killing one another, compromising on our morals, all because
                we've created an unnecessary artificial need of money to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a purely algorithmic and reputation-based approach to wealth distribution,
                non-productive and destructive for-profit-only industries could fall by the wayside. Every
                user of Civil Money is in effect a money lender. There is nothing preventing you from
                accepting money from a person with a low credit score or even a negative balance -- you get paid
                either way by simply accepting their payment. The only question to ask is, <em>should you</em>.
                Predatory or deceitful users should be declined and gently reminded of the Civil Money Honour Code. 
                The level of compassion towards a customer's personal circumstance is up to each individual business or seller.
            </p>

                An inverse-taxation system ensures that geographic regions generate tax revenue based 
                on their actual economic activity in near real-time, and without relying on individual reporting. 10%
                of every transaction generates new money for the region of the seller for use by a Governing Authority
                Civil Money account.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Civil Money monetary system is not a platform for communication or advertisement. As such
                posting of e-mail addresses, phone numbers, personal information or methods of contact are
                expressly discouraged. Dispute resolution is implicit in the system's design and ensures 
                that disputed transactions are always settled amicably, even when both parties disagree.
