            <h1>A society built on a minted currency is toxic.</h1>
            <p><b>People are working multiple jobs, neglecting their children, even killing one another, all because of nothing more than imaginary computer data sitting on bank servers that we like to call money.</b></p>
            <p>For most of us, every waking hour revolves around doing <em>something</em> in order to undo a mortgage or credit database entry. Money that banks literally create out of thin air and inject into the economy, forcing the majority into a position of slavery for fear of repossession. </p>
            <p>Civil Money is a <a href="https://github.com/civilmoney/Reference-Implementation/blob/master/API.md" target="_blank">protocol</a> designed for people who wish to no longer waste their lives working to the benefit of a minority. A global effort to rebuild communities, given the past 200 years of economic adolescence leading current civilisation astray. Here's how it works...</p>
            <img src=/ubi.svg>
            <h2>Every person whether retired, studying, disabled or working receives a generous basic income.</h2>
            <p>Roughly equivalent to USD $60,000 /yr. The idea is that <b>if</b> you work, it is gravy. Work on something because you're actually passionate about it, not because you have to. Stay home and raise your kids properly. Go to school. Do something amazing. If the people and local businesses that you rely on for day-to-day living all chose to accept payment in Civil Money (//c) the decision would be up to you.</p>

            <img src=/taxation.svg>
            <h2>An automatic, inverted taxation system generates money for regions based on their actual contribution to humanity.</h2>
            <p>Tax evasion is impossible, we don't subtract money out of pocket and there is never any tax filing. In other words - <b>tax is dead.</b></p>
            <p>10% of every settled transaction is automatically generated and placed into an authoritative Civil Money account for the seller's geographical region. Any change to the inverse-taxation algorithm will not directly impact people's account balances. Inverse-taxation is a data analysis/computer sciences problem. Specifically, we want to exclude transactions for inverse-tax when a money trail or account looks like it might have been deliberately created to generate false revenue.</p>

            <img src=/datadistribution.svg>
            <h2>All account and transaction information is public and distributed around the world.</h2>
            <p>Data is stored on random untrusted computers and authenticity is established through a simple consensus.</p>
            <p>There is nothing novel or unique about Civil Money's technology.</p>
            <p>Because all data is public, it cannot be used for crime. Not that crimes of desperation need exist in the first place given a generous basic income. Blatantly predatory or deceitful users should be declined, ignored and politely reminded of the Civil Money Honour Code.</p>

            <img src=/nobanks.svg>
            <h2>There are no more banks, foreign exchange rates or financial speculation markets.</h2>
            <p>Every user of Civil Money is a money lender. You get paid no matter what by simply clicking 'accept' on any payment, but the question you should ask yourself is, <em>&quot;should I?&quot;</em></p>
            <p><b>Everybody is a bank</b> under Civil Money, so the willingness to support an exciting sounding business venture, or the level of compassion toward a customer's unfortunate life circumstance is up to each individual business or seller. There is no incentive either way to decline a customer. </p>
            <p>Traditionally a bank's role in society is to do nothing more than protect people from charlatans. Since Civil Money is a public ledger for verifying any participant's credit score or transaction history, a banking and investment sector is unnecessary.</p>

            <img src=/valuetime.svg>
            <h2>The value of one Civil Money is always equal to one hour of a person's time, but also 50 bucks.</h2>
            <p>To transition away from the old economy, a fixed and reasonable exchange rate is set at <b>//c 1.00 = USD $50</b>. This is based on an upper-middle class USD$ 80,000/yr income over an 8hr work day, 200 days a year (excludes 165 days of weekends/personal/sick/vacation time.)</p>
            <blockquote>
                USD$ 80,000 / 1600hrs = $50/hr.<br />
                Since 1hr = //c 1.00 it follows that //c 1.00 = USD$50
            </blockquote>
            <p>This means that a person making designer T-shirts in Bangladesh, which might take a few hours, can no longer be expected to sell their time for a pittance or be compelled to work for a slave wage. Provided that they have access to materials and a personal website, that person can now sell their shirts directly to anybody in the world for a fair value of //c 3.00, equivalent to USD$150, or about what a retail chain might charge in western countries today.</p>

            <img src=/disputes.svg>
            <h2>Dispute resolution is built-in.</h2>
            <p>In the event of a dispute, a customer can always get their money back whilst the seller keeps their payment as well. Arguments are always settled amicably by default.</p>
            <p>Rampant use of the dispute system would lead to inflation, so <b>the catch is</b>, it reflects badly on anyone who abuses it, or any seller who routinely does not volunteer a refund during disputes. </p>
            <p>This system enables access to a fair dispute resolution process to people in countries that currently have no reliable legal system in place, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on small-claims courts in the countries that do.</p>

            <img src=/demurrage.svg>
            <h2>Payments start to depreciate after 12 months.</h2>
            <p>This is difficult to grasp at first, but it benefits the majority in profound ways and is ultimately a non-issue once you've discarded your traditional understanding of money and savings.</p>
            <p><b>You never need to save, there is no debt, and investment and interest do not exist because every individual is a bank.</b></p>
            <p>After 12 months, every transaction slowly depreciates down to 0.00 over the following 12 months. So by 2 years a buyer is always forgiven of their debt and the seller's earnings are removed from the economy.</p>
            <p>Apart from preventing inflation, it makes it impossible for a minority to hoard cash or to use it as a mechanism to enslave others. One of the flaws in the traditional monetary system is that if you have a bunch of money, you can make more of it by not actually doing anything yourself, but instead gambling it on an abstract investment market driven by little more than a fleeting consensus of value which is being egged on by a herd of onlookers. Under Civil Money everybody is encouraged to spend their money soon and in exchange for real tangible goods or services, which ensures the distribution of wealth and a happy and healthy global economy. </p>
            <p>Accounts that ping-pong money in order to circumvent depreciation can be openly identified and declined. Capitalism is not prohibited, but your capital can no longer be held onto long-term in the form of money. Instead it must be converted into physical assets and property. You know... real stuff.</p>

            <img src=/hardtimes.svg>
            <h2>Because payments depreciate, your credit score automatically restores itself if you fall on hard times.</h2>
            <p>Depreciation of account debits along with a perpetually replenishing basic income ensures that people retain their dignity in the event of financial disaster. Nobody needs to struggle without access to essential goods and services for an extended period of time, if at all.</p>

            <h2>The barrier to entry is virtually non-existent, and personally identifying information is disallowed.</h2>
            <p>Civil Money is designed to work just as effectively for a remote village in Africa sharing a single smartphone, as it does a person standing in a shopping mall at a point of sale terminal. All you ever need is <b>temporary</b> access to a reasonably up-to-date web browser to create an account or complete a transaction.</p>
            <p>Because all data is public and poorly implemented business processes sometimes use bills or receipt numbers as a proof of identity, we do not permit storage of anything that traditionally has been used as a source of ID. Civil Money does not allow storage of even so much as your e-mail address.</p>

            <img src=/voting.svg>
            <h2>Every person can vote on changes to the system.</h2>
            <p>People can digitally sign votes in the same manner as regular transactions. A two-thirds majority is needed for any proposition to pass, meaning a significant winning margin is required before any changes are introduced. No vote counts more than another, however the minimum requirement for voting is a good standing and at least one settled transaction for every 30 day period, for the past year. This is simply to deter casual vote stuffing.</p>
            <p>Because Civil Money is a completely transparent system, researchers are encouraged to collect, validate and calculate results independently and report their findings. Voting outcomes are a scientific process and not locked in stone until a consensus with a reasonably low margin of error is established.</p>

            <h2>Identity verification is not a feature of Civil Money.</h2>
            <p><b>The value and authenticity of your account exists only through pre-established relationships with people and companies that you choose to associate with.</b></p>
            <img src=/ripmoney.svg>
            <p>Any idiot can make a bunch of fake accounts and send themselves money -- however it's a worthless pursuit and they're just wasting their time. The Civil Money design is such that illegitimate transactions and accounts are deemed worthless by the community at large, who may easily run a credit report in order to trace a corroborated money trail and determine a customer's legitimacy.</p>
            <p>Let's provide essential goods and services to everybody, and sell people homes or cars based on their contributions to society, whilst simultaneously guiding people to become honest and civilised and repair humanity which has been broken apart by greed, secrecy and mistrust. All it takes is for people to accept payment in //c.</p>
