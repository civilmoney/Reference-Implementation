            <h1>A society built on a minted currency is a toxic one.</h1>
            <p>People are killing one another, working multiple jobs and neglecting their children. All because of nothing more than imaginary computer data sitting on bank servers. For many people their entire life's existence revolves around undoing database entries that were created each time they needed a loan in order to buy a house, car, or even food. Let's fix it.</p>
            <img src=/ubi.svg>
            <h2>Every human whether retired, studying, disabled or working receives a generous basic income.</h2>
            <p>Roughly equivalent to USD $60,000 /yr. The idea is that <b>if</b> you work, it is gravy. Work on something because you're passionate about it, not because you have to. Raise your kids properly. Go to school. Do something amazing. If the people and local businesses that you rely on for day-to-day living all choose to accept payment in Civil Money, the decision will be up to you.</p>

            <img src=/taxation.svg>
            <h2>An automatic, inverted taxation system generates money for regions based on their actual contribution to humanity.</h2>
            <p>Tax evasion is impossible, we don't subtract money out of pocket and there is never any tax filing. In other words - <b>tax is dead.</b></p>
            <p>10% of every settled transaction is automatically generated and placed into an authoritative Civil Money account for the seller's geographical region. Any change to the inverse-taxation algorithm will not directly impact people's account balances. Inverse-taxation is a data analysis/computer sciences problem. Specifically, we want to exclude transactions for inverse-tax when a money trail or account looks like it might have been deliberately created to generate false revenue.</p>

            <img src=/datadistribution.svg>
            <h2>All account and transaction information is public and distributed around the world.</h2>
            <p>Data is stored on random untrusted computers and authenticity is established through a consensus model and well-established cryptographic signing techniques.</p>
            <p>There is nothing novel or unique about Civil Money's technology.</p>
            <p>Because all data is public, it cannot be used for crime. Not that crime need exist in the first place, given the generous basic income. Predatory or deceitful users should be declined, ignored and politely reminded of the Civil Money Honour Code.</p>

            <img src=/nobanks.svg>
            <h2>There are no more banks, foreign exchange rates or financial speculation markets.</h2>
            <p>Every user of Civil Money is a money lender. You will get paid no matter what by simply clicking 'accept' on any payment, but the question you should ask yourself is, <em>&quot;should I?&quot;</em> <b>You are a bank</b>, and a willingness to cooperate and support an exciting sounding business venture, or the level of compassion toward a person's unfortunate life circumstance is up to each individual seller. </p>
            <p>The ultimate aim of Civil Money is to gradually repair broken relationships and guide everybody into behaving openly and honestly with one another, at the same time empowering people to cooperate more easily by completely removing our counter-productive and toxic notion of debt and artificial scarcity from our social fabric. It aims to supplant the traditional economics <em>""""it's every man for himself""""</em> way of thinking, which is the root cause of most of the world's maladies.</p>

            <img src=/valuetime.svg>
            <h2>The value of one Civil Money is always equal to one hour of a person's time, but also 50 bucks.</h2>
            <p>The mathematical constant of time can help somewhat to prevent inflation, however goods and services must be priced appropriately. Civil Money only works if we spend wisely and scrutinise the fair value of items and services that we're purchasing (labour + materials + a reasonable margin) to stop things getting out of hand.</p>
            <p>A reasonable exchange rate in traditional currency is <b>//c 1.00 = USD $50</b>. This is based on an upper-middle class USD$ 80,000/yr income over an 8hr work day, 200 days a year (excludes 165 days of weekends/personal/sick/vacation time.)</p>
            <blockquote>
                USD$ 80,000 / 1600hrs = $50/hr.<br />
                Since 1hr = //p 1.00 it follows that //p 1.00 = USD$50
            </blockquote>
            <p>This means that a person making designer T-shirts in Bangladesh, which might take a few hours, can no longer be expected to sell their time for a pittance or be compelled to work for a slave wage. Provided that they have access to materials and a personal website, that person can now sell their shirts directly to anybody in the world for a fair value of //p 3.00, equivalent to USD$150, or about what a retail chain might charge in western countries today.</p>

            <img src=/disputes.svg>
            <h2>Dispute resolution is built-in.</h2>
            <p>In the event of a dispute, a customer can always get their money back whilst the seller keeps their payment as well. Arguments are always settled amicably by default.</p>
            <p>Rampant use of the dispute system would lead to inflation, so <b>the catch is</b>, it reflects badly on anyone who abuses it, or any seller who routinely does not volunteer a refund during disputes. </p>
            <p>This system enables access to a fair dispute resolution process to people in countries that currently have no reliable legal system in place, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on small-claims courts in the countries that do.</p>

            <img src=/demurrage.svg>
            <h2>Payments start to depreciate after 12 months.</h2>
            <p>This is difficult to grasp at first, and people are going to baulk at the idea. But it's super important and ultimately a non-issue once you've discarded your traditional understanding of money and savings.</p>
            <p><b>You never need to save, there is no debt, and investment and interest do not exist because every individual is a bank.</b></p>
            <p>A fundamental problem with money today is that those who have some of it, can make more of it, simply by moving it.</p>
            <p>Under Civil Money it is impossible for a minority to hoard cash or use it as a tool to make more money. Instead, everyone is encouraged to spend their money soon, which ensures the <b>distribution</b> of wealth and a happy and healthy global economy. Accounts that ping-pong money in order to circumvent depreciation can be openly identified and declined.</p>
            <p><b>Capitalism is not prohibited.</b> But your capital must no longer be held onto long-term in the form of money. Instead it must be converted into physical assets and property. You know... real things.</p>

            <img src=/hardtimes.svg>
            <h2>Because payments depreciate, your credit score automatically restores itself if you fall on hard times.</h2>
            <p>Depreciation of account debits along with a perpetually replenishing basic income ensures that people retain their dignity in the event of financial disaster. Nobody needs to struggle without access to essential goods and services for an extended period of time, if at all.</p>

            <h2>The barrier to entry is virtually non-existent, and personally identifying information is disallowed.</h2>
            <p>Civil Money is designed to work just as effectively for a remote village in Africa sharing a single smartphone, as it does a person standing in a shopping mall at a point of sale terminal. All you ever need is <b>temporary</b> access to a reasonably up-to-date web browser to create an account or complete a transaction.</p>
            <p>Because all data is public and poorly implemented business processes sometimes use bills or receipt numbers as a proof of identity, we do not permit storage of anything that traditionally has been used as a source of ID. Civil Money does not allow storage of even so much as your e-mail address.</p>

            <img src=/voting.svg>
            <h2>Every person can vote on changes to the system.</h2>
            <p>People can digitally sign votes in the same manner as regular transactions. A two-thirds majority is needed for any proposition to pass, meaning a significant winning margin is required before any changes are introduced. No vote counts more than another, however the minimum requirement for voting is a good standing and at least one settled transaction for every 30 day period, for the past year. This is simply to deter casual vote stuffing.</p>
            <p>Because Civil Money is a completely transparent system, researchers are encouraged to collect, validate and calculate results independently and report their findings. Voting outcomes are a scientific process and not locked in stone until a consensus with a reasonably low margin of error is established.</p>

            <h2>Identity verification is not a feature of Civil Money.</h2>
            <p><b>The value and authenticity of your account only exists through pre-established relationships with people and companies that you choose to associate with.</b></p>
            <p>Any idiot can make a bunch of fake accounts and send themselves money -- however it's a worthless pursuit and they're just wasting their time. The Civil Money design is such that illegitimate transactions and accounts are deemed worthless by the community at large, who may easily run a credit report in order to trace a corroborated money trail and determine a customer's legitimacy.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day money doesn't matter any more, only real relationships. Let's build people homes and sell people cars based on what they're truly contributing to society, by putting everyone on an even playing field and taking the imaginary value of cash out of existence.</p>
