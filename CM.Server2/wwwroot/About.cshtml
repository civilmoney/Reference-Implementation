    <h1>Money is nothing.</h1>
    <p>Imagine if you didn't have to work. What would you do?</p>
    <p>Today we work because we need money to survive. But why does it have to be this way?</p>
    <p>What if instead everybody on Earth had a generous basic income, and we were free to do whatever it is we're truly passionate about? Not just whatever makes money...</p>
    <p>People could go back to school, raise their kids properly, or just work on whatever, at their own pace.</p>
    <p>Maybe we could start making things that are designed properly &mdash; long lasting. Beautiful.</p>
    <p>The only reason we don't do these things now is because of money.</p>
    <p>Each and every product produced and even our basic health and well being are negatively impacted by a toxic and unnecessary enterprise culture that puts profits before the greater good.</p>

    <h2>There has to be a better way.</h2>
    <p>We think there might be &mdash; time.</p>
    <p>Time is an inflation-proof mathematical constant and an equal common denominator that everybody can expend, at least in some form or another.</p>
    <p>By switching to time as our new social contract, humanity can step off its income inequality hamster wheel and forgo churning out products for the sake of quarterly revenue targets which is producing a relentless torrent of garbage winding up in landfills and poisoning the very air we need to breathe. </p>
    <p>All it takes is for people to choose to switch to time as their accepted method of payment.</p>

    <h2>Why is traditional money unnecessary?</h2>
    <p>In a word &mdash; computers.</p>
    <p>You may have learned in high school or economic theory that banks act as intermediaries, holding people's deposits and savings. This is no longer their primary role.</p>
    <p>In olden times, banks provided security of assets and protection from charlatans. Today most money exists only as data sitting on bank computers. In other words &mdash; <b>money is nothing</b>, created out of thin air. As much as 90% of money in circulation has been created by banking institutions each time they've issued loans and credit.</p>
    <p>This means that for every dollar in your checking account, some person somewhere else owes a bank around 90 cents, and is doing their darnedest to earn a wage in order to undo that credit database record. Billions of people on Earth are wasting every waking hour trying to delete a database entry from a bank computer. Meanwhile those in the finance industries amass a lions share of wealth produced out of nothing under the guise of interest. </p>
    <p>Since we've identified that most money exists only in a virtual sense, banks and financial speculation markets can become obsolete if all transactions are recorded on an open public ledger and a simple consensus can be established regarding the status of any person's account and credit rating using computers.</p>
    <p>Participants of Civil Money are effectively a bank manager, able to audit customers in the same way banks have traditionally done in the past from behind their desks when authorizing a new loan. Of course, being a bank manager is work, so the design of Civil Money allows for a corroborated credit score to be displayed instantly at the point of sale, with an option to perform a more thorough analysis on particularly high value purchases.</p>

    <h2>The Civil Money design.</h2>
    <p>Because we're dispensing with economic text books and re-writing them:</p>

    <h3>1. Taxation is now real-time and inverted.</h3>
    <p>Tax evasion is impossible, we don't subtract money out of pocket and there is never any tax filing.</p>
    <p>10% of every settled transaction is automatically generated as new money and placed into an authoritative Civil Money account for the seller's geographical region which government authorities may access for tax revenue spending. Any change to the inverse-taxation algorithm is a macro-economic adjustment which will not directly impact people's account balances. Inverse-taxation is a data analysis/computer sciences problem. Specifically, we want to exclude transactions for inverse-tax when a money trail or account looks like it might have been deliberately created to generate false revenue.</p>

    <h3>2. Every person whether retired, studying, disabled or working receives a generous basic income.</h3>
    <p>Roughly equivalent to USD $60,000 /yr. The idea is that if you work, it is gravy. Work on something because you're actually passionate about it, not because you have to. Money is no longer important and we as a society need to encourage people to <b>not work</b> in lieu of creating pollution and producing low quality or planned-obsolescence items that will end up in a landfill.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the impact of a sudden widespread availability of income and access to basic goods and services we hope will have a few profoundly positive implications for society at large.</p>
    <p>For instance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Access to unbounded education or time for scientific or academic research.</li>
        <li>Improved nutrition through quality-centric agriculture and food design, instead of cost-centric and monetary yield.</li>
        <li>The localization of agriculture and affability of locally grown foods, instead of imports produced on the backs of slave labor or weaker currency differentials.</li>
        <li>Strengthened relationships, parenting and families through the availability of time.</li>
        <li>A drastic reduction or elimination in all forms of petty crime.</li>
        <li>Improved health and longevity through reduced stress.</li>
        <li>Automation and an elimination of most forms of unpleasant jobs through an open sharing of knowledge and ingenuity.</li>
        <li>Unrestricted funding for grand ideas, inventors and creators.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>3. The value of one Civil Money is equal to at least one hour of a person's time, with a minimum-wage of USD $50/hr.</h3>
    <p>Civilised Money places no limitations on the cost of goods and services. But to transition away from the old economy, a fixed and reasonable exchange rate is set at <b>//c 1.00 = USD $50</b>. </p>
    <p>This minimum-wage is based on an upper-middle class USD$ 80,000/yr income over an 8hr work day, 200 days of work a year, which excludes 165 days of weekends, personal, sick and vacation time.</p>
    <blockquote>
        USD$ 80,000 / 1600hrs = $50/hr.<br />
        Since 1hr = //c 1.00 it follows that //c 1.00 = USD$50
    </blockquote>
    <p>This means that a person making designer T-shirts in Bangladesh, which might take a few hours, can no longer be expected to sell their time for a pittance or be compelled to work for a slave wage. Provided that they have access to materials and a personal website, that person can now sell their shirts directly to anybody in the world for a fair value of //c 3.00, equivalent to USD$150, or about what a retail chain might charge in western countries today.</p>
    <p>For seasonal workers or people in high demand, there is no restriction on how much they can charge for their time.</p>

    <h3>4. Dispute resolution is built-in.</h3>
    <p>In the event of a dispute, a customer can always get their money back whilst the seller keeps their payment as well. Arguments are always settled amicably by default.</p>
    <p>Rampant use of the dispute system would lead to inflation, so <b>the catch is</b>, it reflects badly on anyone who abuses it, or any seller who routinely does not volunteer a refund during disputes. </p>
    <p>This system enables access to a fair dispute resolution process to people in countries that currently have no reliable legal system in place, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on small-claims courts in the countries that do.</p>

    <h3>5. Payments start to depreciate after 12 months.</h3>
    <p>This is difficult to grasp at first, but it benefits the majority in positive ways and is ultimately a non-issue once you've discarded your traditional understanding of money and savings.</p>
    <blockquote>You never need to save, there is no debt, and investment and interest do not exist because every individual is a bank.</blockquote>
    <p>After 12 months, every transaction slowly depreciates down to 0.00 over the following 12 months. So by 2 years a buyer is always forgiven of their debt and the seller's earnings are removed from the economy.</p>
    <p>Apart from preventing inflation, it makes it impossible for a minority to hoard cash or to use it as a mechanism to enslave others. Under Civil Money everybody is encouraged to spend their money soon and in exchange for real tangible goods or services, which ensures the distribution of wealth and a happy and healthy global economy. </p>
    <p>Accounts that ping-pong money in order to circumvent depreciation can be openly identified and declined. Capitalism is not prohibited, but your capital can no longer be held onto long-term in the form of money. Instead it must be converted into physical assets and property. Real stuff.</p>

    <p>Depreciation of account debits along with a perpetually replenishing basic income ensures that people retain their dignity in the event of financial disaster. Nobody needs to struggle without access to essential goods and services for an extended period of time, if at all.</p>

    <h3>6. Every person can vote on changes to the system.</h3>
    <p>People can digitally sign votes in the same manner as regular transactions. A two-thirds majority is needed for any proposition to pass, meaning a significant winning margin is required before any changes are introduced. No vote counts more than another, however the minimum requirement for voting is a good standing and at least one settled transaction for every 30 day period, for the past year. This is simply to deter casual vote stuffing.</p>
    <p>Because Civil Money is a completely transparent system, researchers are encouraged to collect, validate and calculate results independently and report their findings. Voting outcomes are a scientific process and not locked in stone until a consensus with a reasonably low margin of error is established.</p>

    <h3>7. Identity verification is not even bothered with.</h3>
    <p>The value and authenticity of accounts exist mostly through pre-established offline relationships with people and companies that we choose to associate with.</p>
    <p>There are a number of benefits to this &quot;hand's off&quot; approach to identity verification:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The barrier to entry is basically zero, all you ever need is momentary access to a computer to complete a transaction or establish an account. Civil Money should work just as effectively for a remote village in Africa sharing a single smartphone as it will a person at a point of sale terminal in a mall, or on an iPad on a couch in someone's living room.</li>
        <li>Any idiot can make a bunch of fake accounts and send themselves money &mdash; however it's a worthless pursuit and they're just wasting their time. Their account is worthless to society until they establish real offline relationships. At which point, the balance of their account and the provenance of their credit rating is immaterial. There is no incentive either way for any seller to decline a patron. More important is &quot;is this person friendly&quot;. This has an intended consequence of restoring communities by opening a channel of communication and removing mistrust, anonymity, crime, dishonesty and deception.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2 style="page-break-before:always;">Criticisms.</h2>

    <h3>Necessity is the mother of invention.</h3>
    <p>
        The need to solve problems through creative efforts will never go away, and it's natural to presume that much of modern progress
        might be attributed to our artificially scarce monetary framework forcing companies to fight it out with one another in the global marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
        We submit
        that a monetary incentive need not be the primary driver of creative problem solving but rather shear curiosity and financial freedom. Access to basic wealth frees
        the technically minded to pursue advancements not only for profit, but for the love of their craft and science itself. Since everybody is a bank manager, people are free to support any exciting sounding project or initiative being undertaken by any customer. All it takes is for the seller to click 'accept' on a payment, even if the customer's credit has completely run out &mdash; a buyer is always 'good for it' and you get paid no matter what.
    </p>

    <h3>People can be dishonest.</h3>
    <p>Dishonesty is the unattractive byproduct of wealth inequality. A civilized monetary system should forgive people of their debts and place more of a focus on relationships, cooperation and communication rather than strict zero-sum accounting. </p>
    <p>We believe that dishonesty as well as most crime can be eliminated with a reformed monetary system that does not discriminate against people based on ethnicity, gender or geographic place of birth, which are factors that in the traditional economy play a more significant determination of one's wealth than how hard they work or how honest they are. Indeed honesty in the enterprise culture often goes against fiduciary obligations, such is the case for disclosure of hazardous chemical compounds or the acceptance of liability or a full and proper remedy after any activity that impacts the environment.</p>

    <h3>People are lazy, nothing will get done.</h3>
    <p>
        Under the traditional economy, unpleasant jobs come with not only crappy pay, but also a sort of social stigma. Civil Money wishes to turn this toxic culture on its head. The janitor clocking in 12 hours a day on his feet should be regarded more highly by society than the CEO who's only actual skill is social charisma and contacts having influence or money.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sudden drop in productivity is likely to be seen in manual labor and unpleasant jobs, however the goal of Civil Money is to supplant such menial tasks through automation and ingenuity.
    </p>

    <h3>A sudden widespread availability of wealth might result in an unprecedented rate of unbounded resource consumption.</h3>
    <p>This is the only argument against Civil Money of any concern right now. The fact is, we don't have a clue what will happen and nor can we accurately predict or model any theoretical outcome, because if economic models have taught us anything in the past, it's that they're almost always wrong.</p>
    <p>Monetary reform is only half of the equation. The second half of mending society is that we also need a global resource management system. A distributed ledger, similar to Civil Money except for geographical boundaries, resources and their state of restoration. The distribution and mining of these boundaries then need to be considered based solely on scientific merit and actual societal need. In contrast, there is no worldwide shortage of gold today, 93% of it sits in vaults as financial instruments and jewelery. All gold extraction initiatives going on right now are for no reason other than to float it on an abstract market and produce a momentary bump in stock price for a handful of people to cash out, instead of any true practical use or market demand such as electronics or products. Under Civil Money, these sorts of ludicrous 'for money only' environmental train wrecks become a thing of the past.</p>

    <h3>Won't the credit system end up like that 'Black Mirror' episode?</h3>
    <p>You know the one. The dystopian vision of the future where that girl's credit is reduced to garbage based on her interactions with a few people and she's unable to buy stuff and folks with a lot of credits shun those having low credit. </p>
    <p>That scenario doesn't play out under Civil Money. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Only <b>you</b> can lower your own credit. Nobody is able to down-vote you in any way. You are in complete control over your account and it's up to you to spend within your generous basic income in a sensible way and act honestly.</li>
        <li>The full depreciation on transactions after 2 years prevents the over accumulation of wealth. What's more is the maximum possible credit score is 100. Acquiring any higher monetary value is a waste of time.</li>
        <li>At the end of the day, money means nothing. We're switching to a civilized people-driven monetary system.</li>
    </ol>
