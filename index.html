        <h1><b>//Civilised</b> Money.</h1>

        <p>
            We need a framework that is more civilised than money and economics if we are to
            continue to survive within Earth's biosphere. Artificial scarcity of monetary wealth has
            created a toxic society and laid waste to our planet.
        </p>
        <p>Let's be more civilised.</p>
        <p class="dont-print big-space">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Every person on Earth now has a universal basic income. We ask that you stop working,
            in lieu of depleting resources and causing pollution for no reason beyond money.
            Unless your work brings you personal joy, fulfilment or benefits your community &mdash; stop.
        </p>
        <p>Time is now our preferred unit of currency.</p>
        <p>
            Tax is now implicit and does not come out of your pocket. 10% of every transaction
            generates new money from thin air for the seller's physical location. This is money for
            social services, roads, utilities, infrastructure, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your account and identity is not important and you can start over at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time spent on any positive action, cause or endeavour is considered valuable and
            deserving of compensation in the civilised economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any ad-hoc collaboration, creature or resource may establish a Civilised Money account. Animal welfare and environmental preservation as well as
            education, healthcare, research and social services are fully funded by default.
        </p>
        <p>We ask that you give the utmost respect to people doing unpleasant work.</p>
        <p>
            We also ask that you strive to eliminate unpleasant work and manual labour
            through the sharing of ideas and ingenuity, with an eye toward automation.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're making something that uses resources, we ask that you take your time with it and make it
            beautiful and long-lasting.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ask that you accept anybody's payment, even if you don't trust or like them.
            People are only deceitful or sociopathic because money, either a lack of access to or an overabundance,
            caused them to become that way under the old economic system. It will take us several
            generations for our society to heal.
        </p>
        <p>Money is no longer capital.</p>
